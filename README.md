# AddressBloc: A simple Address Book that runs from the Terminal

![](/assets/address_bloc_main_menu.png)

This repository holds AddressBloc, which is a small, easy-to-use address book that you can use within your Terminal. After uploading a CSV file full of contacts, you'll be able to easily navigate through the address book to view, edit, and/or delete contacts.

### Prerequisites

This project assumes you have Ruby >= 2.3.0 and that you're working on a Unix or Linux machine. Besides that, you're good to go! This repo already comes with a CSV of 5 contacts, so you can edit that as you wish.

### Getting Started

If you want to try this backend application yourself, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the new `address-bloc` directory
3. Type `ruby address_bloc.rb` in your terminal to start the program
4. Use option 4 to import a CSV file of contacts - as long as the CSV is in the same directory as `address_bloc.rb`, just type the file name.
5. Navigate the address book menu as you please!

_Warning_: Once you exit the program (option 6 on the main menu), all of your contacts data will be **erased**!
